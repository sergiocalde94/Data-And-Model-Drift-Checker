# Welcome to `pydrift` 0.1.0 :bar_chart:

How do we measure the degradation of a machine learning process? Why does the performance of our predictive models decrease? Maybe it is that a data source has changed (one or more variables) or maybe what changes is the relationship of these variables with the target we want to predict. `pydrift` tries to facilitate this task to the data scientist, performing this kind of checks and somehow measuring that degradation.

# Install `pydrift` :v:
